# CSCI-Senior-Project: The Far Journey by Andrew Marshall & James Blankenship
Our project is a 3D real time
game in the Unreal engine. The game is a fantasy genre in a
medieval setting. The game will have 3 levels in it. It will have
a variety of enemies and weapons. There will be magic. The
different types of magic for the player to use would include
pyromancy, sorcery, and faith based magic. You can upgrade
weapons and get access to abilities in the game. The upgrade
system, and the ability system are meant to give the player the
ability to make a build that fits with their play style. With each
level the enemies will gain hp and do more damage. Each
level will have a boss enemy in it.
TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
We are using Unreal Engine for our project. We will be using
C++ and blueprints in Unreal and behavior trees for the ai.
Behavior trees are essentially used to create ai by having
branches that decide actions.1 Blueprints will be used in places
that require simple execution such as taking the player to a
new level. C++ will be used for more complex tasks. An
example would be the ai just searching and then it will execute
a different branch when it finds someone. GitHub is being
used for collaboration with each other. All the assets that ae
currently being used is in the unreal store.
